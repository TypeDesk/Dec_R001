<P>reached by road. here one may sit at ease on shady porches and overlook one of the most extended,<br>varied and romantic views in the world of scenery. one may take dinner on this porch and have sunset<br>served with dessert and the afterglow with coffee. here again one is haunted by the suggestion of<br>artistic intention, so happy is the composition of this extraordinary picture. the foreground is the dark,<br>tremendous gulf of merced canyon, relieved by the silver shimmer of vernal and nevada falls. from this<br>in middle distance rises, in the centre of the canvas, the looming tremendous personality of half dome,<br>here seen in profile strongly suggesting a monk with outstretched arms blessing the valley at close of<br>day. beyond stretches the horizon of famous, snowy, glacier shrouded mountains, golden in sunset glow.<br>every summer many thousands of visitors gather in yosemite. most of them, of course, come tourist<br>fashion, to glimpse it all in a day or two or three. a few thousands come for long enough to taste most<br>of it, or really to see a little. fewer, but still increasingly many, are those who come to live a little<br>with yosemite; among these we find the lovers of nature, the poets, the seers, the dreamers, and the<br>students. living is very pleasant in the yosemite. the freedom from storm during the long season, the<br>dry warmth of the days and the coldness of the nights, the inspiration of the surroundings and the<br>completeness of the equipment for the comfort of visitors make it extraordinary among mountain<br>resorts. there is a hotel in the valley, and another upon the rim at glacier point. there are three large<br>hotel camps in the valley, where one may have hotel comforts under canvas at camp prices. two of<br>these hotel camps possess swimming pools, dancing pavilions, tennis courts electrically lighted for night<br>play, hot and cold water tubs and showers, and excellent table service. one of the hotel camps, the<br>largest, provides evening lectures, song services, and a general atmosphere suggestive of chatauqua.<br>still a third is for those who prefer quiet retirement and the tradition of old fashioned camp life. above<br>the valley rim, besides the excellent hotel upon glacier point, there are at this writing hotel camps<br>equipped with many hotel comforts, including baths, at such outlying points as merced lake and<br>tenaya lake; the former centering the mountain climbing and trout fishing of the stupendous region on<br>the southwest slope of the park, and the latter the key to the entire magnificent region of the<br>tuolumne. these camps are reached by mountain trail, tenaya lake camp also by motor road. the hotel<br>camp system is planned for wide extension as growing demand warrants. there are also hotels outside<br>park limits on the south and west which connect with the park roads and trails. the roads, by the way,<br>are fair. three enter from the west, centering at yosemite village in the valley; one from the south by<br>way of the celebrated mariposa grove of giant sequoias; one from el portal, terminus of the yosemite<br>railway; and one from the north, by way of several smaller sequoia groves, connecting directly with the<br>tioga road. above the valley rim and north of it, the tioga road crosses the national park and emerges<br>at mono lake on the east, having crossed the sierra over tioga pass on the park boundary. the tioga<br>road, which was built in, on the site of the mono trail, to connect a gold mine west of what has since<br>become the national park with roads east of the sierra, was purchased in by patriotic lovers of the<br>yosemite and given to the government. the mine having soon failed, the road had been impassable for<br>many years. repaired with government money it has become the principal highway of the park and the<br>key to its future development. the increase in motor travel to the yosemite from all parts of the country<br>which began the summer following the great war, has made this gift one of growing importance. it<br>affords a new route across the sierra. but hotels and hotel camps, while accommodating the great<br>majority of visitors, by no means shelter all. those who camp out under their own canvas are likely to<br>be yosemites most appreciative devotees. the camping out colony lives in riverside groves in the upper<br>reaches of the valley, the government assigning locations without charge. many families make<br>permanent summer homes here, storing equipment between seasons in the village. others hire equipment<br>complete, from tents to salt cellars, on the spot. some who come to the hotels finish the season under<br>hired canvas, and next season come with their own. an increasing number come in cars, which they<br>keep in local garages or park near their canvas homes. living is easy and not expensive in these camp<br></P>
